# Cluster-based_extraction_OnSSET
Developed in order to facilitate the GIS extraction for OnSSET when the population base layer in the analysis is a polygon layer

### Introduction

The following repository includes an extraction plugin used in order to automate the GIS data extraction for cluster-based OnSSET analysis. The plugin is developed in a PyQGIS interface and adapted to be run direclty in QGIS (version 3.0 or newer). 

The repository includes a zipped plugin folder that can be directly installed into QGIS as well as instruction on how to install and run the plugin.
